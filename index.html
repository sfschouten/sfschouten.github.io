<h3 class="archive__subtitle">About me</h3>

<p>
I'm a PhD candidate at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (<a href="http://www.cltl.nl/">CLTL</a>), supervised by Piek Vossen and Peter Bloem.
</p>

<p>
My interests are primarily with the role of reasoning in Natural Language Understanding, for example:
<ul>
  <li>Developing methods to systematically evaluate the ability to reason.</li>
  <li>How reasoning can be used to integrate disparate sources of knowledge.</li>
  <li>Investigating if systems reasoning about themselves can aid in the creation of explainable AI.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
I obtained a BSc in Computer Science from Utrecht University, and a MSc in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Amsterdam.
