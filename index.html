<h3 class="archive__subtitle">About me</h3>

<p>
I'm a PhD candidate at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (<a href="http://www.cltl.nl/">CLTL</a>), supervised by Piek Vossen and Peter Bloem.
</p>

<p>
One of my main interests is the integration of knowledge and machine learning.
Particularly topics such as: incorporating semantics in knowledge graph embeddings; 
the use of deep learned models for ontology population; 
or direct integration of reasoning in neural networks (Neurosymbolic AI).

I am also interested in the creation of more eXplainable AI. Particularly where this also involves the topics above.

Solutions that involve the use of probabilistic deep learning are especially exciting to me.

<p>
I obtained a BSc in Computer Science from Utrecht University, and a MSc in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Amsterdam.
